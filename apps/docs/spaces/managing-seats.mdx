## What are Seats?

Seats represent the number of team members who can be part of your Pro space. Each member you invite to your space requires one seat, and you're billed based on your total seat count.

<Card title="Seat Management" icon="users">
- **Used Seats**: Current number of active members in your space
- **Total Seats**: Maximum number of members you're paying for
- **Available Seats**: Remaining seats you can use to invite new members
</Card>

## Accessing Seat Management

To manage your seats, you need to:

1. **Be a space owner** - Only space owners can manage billing and seats (admins can access space settings but not billing)
2. **Have a Pro space** - Seat management is available after upgrading to Pro
3. **Navigate to billing settings** - Go to your space settings and select "Billing"

## Adding Seats

When you need to invite more team members than your current seat allocation allows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Billing Settings">
    Navigate to your space settings and click on the "Billing" tab.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Manage Seats">
    Once your space is upgraded to Pro, you'll see a "Manage Seats" button on the billing page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Increase Seat Count">
    Use the seat selector to increase the number of seats to accommodate your new team members.
    
    <Note>
    You can increase seats to any number you need. There's no upper limit on seat allocation.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Changes">
    Review the cost changes and confirm. The additional seats will be available immediately, and you'll be charged a prorated amount for the current billing period.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Removing Seats

To reduce costs when team members leave or you no longer need as many seats:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Remove Members First">
    Before reducing seat count, make sure to remove any members who are no longer part of your team from the Members tab.
    
    <Warning>
    You cannot reduce seats below your current member count. Remove members first, then adjust seats.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Manage Seats">
    Go to your space billing settings and click the "Manage Seats" button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Decrease Seat Count">
    Use the seat selector to reduce the number of seats to match your current needs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Reduction">
    Review the changes and confirm. You'll receive a credit for the unused seats on your next billing cycle.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<Warning>
If you're having trouble managing seats, check these common issues:
</Warning>

- **Cannot reduce seats**: Make sure you've removed members first - you cannot have fewer seats than active members
- **Manage Seats button missing**: Ensure your space is upgraded to Pro - this feature is only available for Pro spaces
- **Not authorized**: Only space owners can manage seats - members and admins cannot access this feature
- **Payment issues**: Ensure your payment method is up to date before making seat changes

<Info>
Seat management gives you complete flexibility to scale your team up or down based on your actual needs, with immediate availability and fair prorated billing.
